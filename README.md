# react-copy

Super simplified copy of React, so I can understand how React actually works under the hood.

## Setup


Install the live-server npm package globally

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

Change directory to src

```bash
cd src
```

Serve the project directory by

```bash
live-server .
```

Browse [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
